### Installation
To get you started, we have come up with three different installation methods for Kendo. Below, we will explain these method, so you can decide which installation method to use.

#### Core
If you do not have a license of Kendo PRO, then you can use Kendo CORE for free. As Kendo Core is available on Github, this installation method is easiest.

__You should use this installation method if you do not have a license for Kendo PRO__

#### JSPM-git
JSPM-git is a JSPM endpoint plugin that allows you to download Kendo PRO from Telerik's bower endpoint. You need valid, working, Telerik credentials for this to work. When you download Kendo via JSPM-git, it is downloaded in the `jspm_packages/kendo` folder.

__We recommend this installation method if you have a Kendo PRO license and have Telerik credentials__

#### Vendors
If you do not have Telerik credentials, but do have a license and the files of Kendo PRO, you can install Kendo via the "Vendors" method. Essentially, this is a folder named `vendors` containing all the files of Kendo PRO. With a JSPM configuration option, you tell the aurelia-kendoui-plugin to download the Kendo files from this `vendors` folder.

__We recommend this method if you have Kendo PRO files, have a license, but don't have Telerik credentials__
