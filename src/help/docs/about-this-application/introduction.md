## 1 Introduction

<br>

The help category named **"About this application"** refers to the **[standalone instance](http://aurelia-ui-toolkits.github.io/demo-kendo)** of the **[embedded sample application](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-kendoui-plugin/tree/master/sample)** in the **[Aurelia-KendoUI bridge](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-kendoui-plugin)** project.

This explanation will make more sense after checking the information in the category **About KendoUI bridge**, which explains the overal structure of the Aurelia plugin project which implements KendoUI bridge. Note that we are using the term **bridge** to point out the specific **purpose** of the Aurelia KendoUI plugin project - to implement the Aurelia friendly interface / bridge to KendoUI controls set.
