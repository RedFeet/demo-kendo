### Introduction

This article presents the **overview** of the ways to use **[Aurelia-KendoUI-Plugin](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-kendoui-plugin)** project developed by the team of Aurelia UI Toolkits organization, dedicated to ensure Aurelia's wide spread adoption it deserves.

You can find more details in the section **Using KendoUI bridge** which is also a part of this documents set

### How to use this application

Most people like explanations that are done in the context of doing what is just being explained - so let's do something very simple as the first step in showing how to use KendoUI bridge to add an interesting page to the well known application: Aurelia Skeleton Navigation, a starter kit for building a standard navigation-style app with Aurelia. Get it from **[here](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation)** and use the Download ZIP method so we do not have to deal with Git issues in this simple context. After downloading this application, extract its content into the folder conveniently named `skeleton-navigation-kendo` and use the instructions to build and run this app as explained in the **[README](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation/blob/master/README.md)** file. Specifically, assuming that you already have the NodeJS, jspm and gulp installed, this application should be running after you execute

```
npm install
jspm install
gulp watch
```

and subsequently browse to http://localhost:9000, resulting with the following:

Now, we want to add one additional page to this application that would show KendoUI grid with several "bells and whistles" shown below (rendered in Material black theme):

At this point, while following the series of steps described next, it is assumed that you have the KendoUI package already installed on your computer as described in the **vendors** type of installation:

and that you executed all 7 steps (partially) shown on image 3 above. While all of them are equally important, at this point verify that your  `main.js` class looks like this:

```javascript
import 'bootstrap';

export function configure(aurelia) {
  aurelia.use
    .standardConfiguration()
    .developmentLogging()
    .plugin('aurelia-kendoui-plugin', (kendo) => kendo.pro());

  aurelia.start().then(a => a.setRoot());
}

```
