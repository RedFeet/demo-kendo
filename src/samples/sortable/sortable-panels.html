            <h4>What Carl Sagan Taught Me About Software</h4>
            <p class="blog-info">Thursday, February 13, 2014 by Kendo UI</p>
            <p>Software ecosystems are vital to a developer's success.

Ecosystems don't just sprout up overnight though. It takes the right timing, the perfect conditions and lots of love and cultivation. Trying to actively create a new ecosystem around a product or platform is a lot like terraforming. Carl Sagan knows a thing or two about that.</p>
